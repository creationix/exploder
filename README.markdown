# Exploder Demo

This is a simple client-only demo showing how to create two sprite types.

Click and drag on the screen to see the explosions.

The first type is the circles.  They are created at page load and bounce off the walls forever.

The second type is the sparks. They fly faster and die after either a specified timeout or fly off the screen.

The bounding box is the entire window and is dynamic.
